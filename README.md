----------

This is a simple introduction to opening Excel, creating a workbook, creating a worksheet and adding some data.  This script is best run by entering the text line-by-line into Python. A complete description of this script can be found at  [http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/09/basic-excel-driving-with-python/](http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/09/basic-excel-driving-with-python).  

erpdata.py
---------------

This script loads the spreadsheet file ABCDCatering.xls, prepares it for pivot table insertion and saves the file.  The output spreadsheet is written to the file newABCDCatering.xls.  A complete description of this script can be found at  [http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/11/cleaning-up-corporate-erp-data](http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/11/cleaning-up-corporate-erp-data).  

erpdatapivot.py
---------------

This script extends the erpdata.py script by building 5 pivot tables based on the input spreadsheet file ABCDCatering.xls.  The output spreadsheet is written to the file newABCDCatering.xls.  A complete description of this script can be found at  [http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/11/automating-pivot-tables-with-python/](http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/11/automating-pivot-tables-with-python/)

erppivotdragdrop.py
---------------
erppivotdragdrop.py is based on erppivotextended.py and supports dragging and dropping multiple files and simple message box telling you when everything is done. It also does column insertion to derive new data columns for extended data analysis.  The script prepares the poorly formatted table data table from ABCDCatering.xls for pivot table insertion, inserts additional data columns derived from the existing data, and creates 6 pivot tables.  The output spreadsheet is written to the file ABCDCatering_new.xls, or ABCDCatering_new.xlsx, depending on the version of Excel you have on your system.  A description of this script can be found at [http://www.pythonexcels.com/2010/02/a-user-friendly-experience/](http://www.pythonexcels.com/2010/02/a-user-friendly-experience/)

newABCDCatering.xls
------------------

newABCDCatering.xls is the Excel spreadsheet output from erpdata.py and contains a well formatted data table for pivot table conversion.  Use of this file is described in the post [http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/11/introducing-pivot-tables](http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/11/introducing-pivot-tables).  

open_an_existing_workbook.py
----------------------------

This script opens an existing workbook and displays it (note the statement excel.Visible = True).  The file workbook1.xlsx would exist in the user's "My Documents" directory.  You can also open spreadsheet files by specifying the full path to the file as shown below.  Using r' in the statement r'C:\myfiles\excel\workbook2.xlsx' automatically escapes the backslash characters and makes the file name a bit more concise.  Described in post [http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/10/python-excel-mini-cookbook/](http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/10/python-excel-mini-cookbook/)


ranges_and_offsets.py
---------------------

This script uses some different techniques for addressing cells using the <code>Cells()</code> and <code>Range()</code> operators.   Described in post [http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/10/python-excel-mini-cookbook/](http://www.pythonexcels.com/2009/10/python-excel-mini-cookbook/)

row_height.py
-------------

Similar to column height, row height can be set with the RowHeight setting.  You can also use <code>AutoFit()</code> to automatically adjust the row height based on cell contents.
